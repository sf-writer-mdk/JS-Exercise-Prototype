    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.

      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
          + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
          + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. Global binding - In a function call at the global scope 'this' points to the 'window object'

    2. Implicit binding - In objects 'this' is used inside of a method to point to the object in which it was created

    3. Explicit binding - 'this' can be used with the 'call', 'apply', and 'bind' methods. In 'bind', 'this' will be used to bind a function call to another function.
    In 'call' and 'apply', 'this' calls the original function

    4. 'new' binding - 'this' is used with the 'new' keyword when creating objects from a constructor function. 'this' sets the properties and values of the constructor to the object created by it
